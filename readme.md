# [JavaScript games]


## Quick start

* Fork the repo
* Add your game into a new folder under "games"
* Make a pull request

## More info

* This is a repository created after our little talk about Game development in JavaScript.
* The goal is to let people create a quick game in js and share it (and read other's code, of course)
* Feel free to use any framework

## Last but not least

* I think this is a good way to let people share their games.
* I'll make a nicer web and post it, I promise. But in the meanwhile it's just an index.
